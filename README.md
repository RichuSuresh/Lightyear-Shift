# Lightyear-Shift
Lightyear Shift is an arcade shoot em up style videogame designed to improve hand eye coordination.

In the game you play as a spaceship trying to survive against oncoming enemy ships. Your objective is to kill as many mobs as you can without getting hit by them, but this is no easy feat. The mobs come in 4 different colours and the only way to kill them is using corresponding coloured bullets (the shooting of specific bullets are assigned to different keys).

As you kill more enemy ships, they become faster, making them more of a nuisance to avoid, but fear not, the speed of your ship also increases (to keep it fair at really high speeds). 

1 point is awarded for each regular mob killed. Now you may be wondering... "regular mob?", that's right! Once you amas a total of 50 points, enemy boss ships can spawn, which award 20 points when killed!
